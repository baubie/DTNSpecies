Simulations using the Python interface to Neuron 7.2 (Development Version)
Written by Brandon Aubie

How to Use
==========
Install NEURON along with the Python interface.
To make use of multiple cores (or workstations), install the OpenMP toolset.

View run.py for instructions on running different simulations and reproducing a subset of the figures in Aubie et al. (2012).

In general, once you have a simulation defined (the appropriate lines uncommented in run.py), you can simply run:

# ./run

and the simulations will run in multiple threads.  If OpenMP is not available on your system, you can simply run:

# python run.py

Output files are CSV files suitable for producing graphs with many graphing programs such as GLE (http://glx.sourceforge.net/).
